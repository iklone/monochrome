<h3>About This Website</h3>
<p>This website is the latest incarnation of a string of otaku-themed blogs stretching over the last six years. I am the administrator and writer, iklone, and I post about otaku media.</p>
<p>This site was developed in 2020 and is meant to look like this. It is the fifth anime website I've run, the older (extant) sites are archived <a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/05726480952560360312">here</a> if you want to look around.</p>
<p>I post about a range of topics, primarily anime commentary and analysis (lol). I also post thoughts on otaku culture and anime-adjacent media. My favourite period of anime is around 1995 to 2005.</p>
